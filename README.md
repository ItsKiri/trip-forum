<p>This trip forum is based on the community itseilf instead of those famous spots, hotels or restaurants. Let travelers decide the main content of the forum.</p>
<p>In this forum, people could:</p>
<p>1. Introduce any place with details (For example, in my hometown, there are many beautiful spots with limited reputation. People do not visit there only because they do not know these places. These spots deserve better introduction.)</p>
<p>2. Post blogs about trips they would like to share</p>
<p>3. Find other fellow travelers</p>
<p>4. Help other travelers by sharing information, giving advice and even  being the tour guild if they like and they are in the same place</p>
<p>5. Ask for help</p>
<p>6. Leave comments</p>
<p>7. Vote for all the posts including comments</p>
<p>8. Demonstrates the about page</p>
<p>I believe that once the pandemic is over, the number of travelers would be even more than before. ï¼ˆ</p>
